Questions
1. If you had an extra two weeks for this project, what feature(s) would you add.
   - If I had two extra weeks I would have the page look more professional and 
     the layout be better plus I would have added images of each product on the 
     page because it's nice to see what your getting. I would have also added some 
     contact information for the business and a page that showed the location for 
     the store because you can't really pick up your food if you don't know where 
     the store is. I would have also added a section for someone to add any 
     allergies in.
2. The thing I like the least about Javascript is ...
   - I have nothing against JavaScript other than the fact how 
     window.document.write is written. I didn't like how I can 
     write html in it but then also can't call variables in that line.
